## MAIN IDEA  <br>
<p align="justify"> The main idea of the paper "A Mixed-Methods Study of Marketing Students’ Game-Playing Motivations and Gamification Elements" is to identify and understand various gaming motivations among marketing students and how these motivations relate to gamification elements in higher education. The emerging trend of gamification in education, where marketing educators are increasingly using games (such as Kahoot, Markstrat, or SimBrand) and gamification elements (such as badges and leaderboards) in their classes, supports this relationship. This connection is observable in the definition of gamification itself, which regards gamification as the application of game design elements in a non-game context with the intention of leveraging the motivational factors of games. Proponents of gamified education argue that gamification enhances students' extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to learn. <br> 
Specifically, in this interpretive and convergent mixed-methods study, the research aims to examine the differences in gaming motivations among marketing students and explore their perspectives on various gamification elements in higher marketing education. In this way, the study not only aims to demonstrate the connections to different gamification elements and students' motivational bases through a quantitative approach but also aims to generate a deeper understanding of students' perspectives by analyzing qualitative data. <br>
The paper categorizes students into four groups based on their gaming motivations: social completionists, highly motivated completionists, independent completionists, and pure completionists, and discusses how each group responds to various gamification elements <br>
This paper categorizes students into four groups based on their gaming motivations: social completionists, highly motivated completionists, independent completionists, and pure completionists, and discusses how each group responds to various gamification elements. <br>
1. Social Completionists: Students motivated by the desire to interact and learn with others. They enjoy the social aspects of gamification and prefer group learning settings.<br>
2. Highly Motivated Completionists: Ambitious students who enjoy social learning and have strong internal motivation. They are willing to accept most gamification elements and are motivated by achievement and success in learning. <br>
3. Independent Completionists: Students who prefer to learn independently and are not particularly fond of competitive or social elements of gamification. They are more interested in personal achievement and meaningful learning than social interaction. <br>
4. Pure Completionists: Students who focus on completing their tasks or studies and tend to be critical of gamification. They may view gamification as a distraction and prefer a more traditional learning approach. <br>

<p align="justify">
In this paper, "Game-Playing and Gamification Motivations" refer to the drivers or reasons that motivate students to participate and engage in learning activities that incorporate gamification elements. It includes an understanding of why and how various aspects of game-playing, such as achievement, competition, socialization, and immersion, can motivate students in the educational context. <br> 

### Game-Playing Motivations <br>
<p align="justify">
Achievement: The drive to complete tasks, achieve goals, and receive rewards or recognition for success. <br> 
Competition: The desire to compete with others, excel, or beat records. <br> 
Socialization: Motivation to interact with others, work in teams, and build social relationships. <br> 
Immersion: The desire to engage in the storyline or game world, experience deep immersion, and escape from reality. <br> 

### Gamification Motivations <br> 
<p align="justify">
Engagement and Interaction: Gamification elements are designed to enhance student engagement and interaction with learning materials, often through engaging and interactive tasks. <br> 
Personalized and Dynamic Education: Gamification enables more personalized and responsive education, where students can follow learning paths that suit their pace and interests. <br> 
Feedback and Achievement: Gamification systems often provide instant and continuous feedback, helping students understand their progress and motivating them to keep striving. <br> 
Social Aspects of Learning: Gamification can promote social interaction and collaborative learning, enriching the learning experience and helping students develop interpersonal skills. <br> 
In the context of this paper, understanding game-playing and gamification motivations is essential for designing effective and motivating learning experiences by integrating gamification elements that align with the needs and preference motivations of various groups of stude <br>

## Relevance to the Concept of "Fun" in Games <br> 

The concept of "fun" in games relates to the aspects of enjoyment and pleasure experienced during gameplay. In the context of educational gamification, "fun" can refer to the satisfaction derived from achievements, problem-solving, competition, or cooperation. The findings of the paper indicate that what is considered enjoyable can vary greatly among students, depending on their motivations and individual preferences. <br> 

## Should Gamification Always Be Fun?
Education vs. Entertainment: While many games are played for enjoyment, in education, the primary goal is learning. Gamification should be designed to enhance learning, which may not always be enjoyable in the traditional sense. This underscores that gamification in education must balance between being engaging and enjoyable, as well as effective in achieving learning goals. <br> 

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: Gamification is effective when it can fulfill both intrinsic and extrinsic needs of students. While fun and entertainment (enjoyable aspects) can enhance extrinsic motivation, aspects such as achievement, recognition, and mastery (which may not always be "fun") can fulfill intrinsic needs and support deeper learning. <br> 

Diversification of Methods: It is important to diversify gamification elements to accommodate various types of student motivation. This means that not all aspects of gamification need to be fun in the entertainment sense, but they should contribute to a satisfying learning experience and overall fulfillment. <br> 

In conclusion, gamification in education does not always have to be fun if viewed as pure entertainment, but it should be engaging and fulfilling, promoting learning and personal development. The concept of "fun" in educational gamification is more complex and involves satisfaction derived from various sources of motivation and achievement in the learning 
process. <br> 

## RESULT AND CONCLUSION

The research findings identify four clusters of students with varying game-playing motivations and views on gamification elements: <br>

1. Social Completionists: Students in this cluster have high motivation for socialization and completing studies. They value social learning and group work. Competition is less motivating for them, and they tend to respond positively to gamification elements that support teamwork.<br>
2. Highly Motivated Completionists: These students are highly motivated overall, both in completing studies and social interaction. They enjoy challenges and achievements, and they are open to various gamification elements. <br>
3. Independent Completionists: This cluster shows low motivation for socialization but high motivation for completing studies independently. They prefer working alone and are less responsive to gamification elements promoting competition or group work. <br>
4. Pure Completionists: These students focus on completing tasks with minimal effort. They are less interested in gamification elements and prefer traditional learning approaches. <br>

The educational implications of these findings are that educators need to consider the differences in student motivation and preferences when designing gamified learning experiences. This includes using gamification elements that align with the needs of each cluster, such as enhancing community for social completionists, providing challenges for highly motivated completionists, offering individual control for independent completionists, and providing clear information for pure completionists. <br>

The study contributes to the gamification literature in education by highlighting the importance of understanding students' game-playing motivations and how they influence responses to gamification elements. Recommendations for further research include studying cultural and disciplinary differences, as well as contextualizing measurement scales in education. <br>

In conclusion, a better understanding of student motivations and preferences helps educators develop more effective approaches in implementing gamification in education. <br>
