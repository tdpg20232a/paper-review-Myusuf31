## MAIN IDEA  <br>
<p align="justify"> The main idea of the paper "A Mixed-Methods Study of Marketing Students’ Game-Playing Motivations and Gamification Elements" is to identify and understand various gaming motivations among marketing students and how these motivations relate to gamification elements in higher education. The emerging trend of gamification in education, where marketing educators are increasingly using games (such as Kahoot, Markstrat, or SimBrand) and gamification elements (such as badges and leaderboards) in their classes, supports this relationship. This connection is observable in the definition of gamification itself, which regards gamification as the application of game design elements in a non-game context with the intention of leveraging the motivational factors of games. Proponents of gamified education argue that gamification enhances students' extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to learn. <br> 
Specifically, in this interpretive and convergent mixed-methods study, the research aims to examine the differences in gaming motivations among marketing students and explore their perspectives on various gamification elements in higher marketing education. In this way, the study not only aims to demonstrate the connections to different gamification elements and students' motivational bases through a quantitative approach but also aims to generate a deeper understanding of students' perspectives by analyzing qualitative data. <br>
The paper categorizes students into four groups based on their gaming motivations: social completionists, highly motivated completionists, independent completionists, and pure completionists, and discusses how each group responds to various gamification elements <br>
This paper categorizes students into four groups based on their gaming motivations: social completionists, highly motivated completionists, independent completionists, and pure completionists, and discusses how each group responds to various gamification elements. <br>
1. Social Completionists: Students motivated by the desire to interact and learn with others. They enjoy the social aspects of gamification and prefer group learning settings.<br>
2. Highly Motivated Completionists: Ambitious students who enjoy social learning and have strong internal motivation. They are willing to accept most gamification elements and are motivated by achievement and success in learning. <br>
3. Independent Completionists: Students who prefer to learn independently and are not particularly fond of competitive or social elements of gamification. They are more interested in personal achievement and meaningful learning than social interaction. <br>
4. Pure Completionists: Students who focus on completing their tasks or studies and tend to be critical of gamification. They may view gamification as a distraction and prefer a more traditional learning approach. <br>

## Research Objectives <br>
<p align="justify"> The research objectives in this paper are: <br>
Identifying and Understanding Gaming Motivations: To explore different gaming motivations among marketing students and how these motivations influence their acceptance of gamification elements. <br> 
Classification of Students Based on Gaming Motivations: To categorize students into clusters based on their gaming motivations to understand how these preferences affect their interaction with gamification elements in education. <br>
